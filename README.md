This Project is based on Dialysis Healthcare Analysis where we had two CSV files namely Dialysis-I and Dialysis-II.

We had over 7K+ records in each files.

Worked on key metrics like patient statistics, treatments, facility ratings and organizational performances like Total Performance Score and Chain Organizations. 

Uncovered insights into readmission rates, profitability and regional facility distribution enhancing decision making for healthcare management.

For some KPI's we had to convert discrete columns into continuous columns oe vice-verse to get the desired output.

In Tableau, we even created some calculated fields for KPI like category texts as expected in which we filtered the data accordingly.

Changed data type when needed.

At last, designed a robust interactive dashboard in Tableau. It will filter data accordingly when clicked on one particular visual of KPI's.

Conducted a thorough cleaning and cleansing operation in Excel and imported dataset into MYSQL to analyze and get exact numbers by using aggregate functions and so on.

For Power BI, we created on to one relationship in dialysis 1 and dialysis 2 as both columns contain unique values, even had to use quick measure for different calculations.
